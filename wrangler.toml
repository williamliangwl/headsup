# Environment Variables - Managed via Cloudflare Dashboard
# =========================================================
# These variables are configured directly in the Cloudflare Dashboard
# to allow runtime changes without requiring code deployments.
# 
# To update these values:
# 1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers & Pages > vendor-announcement-detector
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
# 3. Add/modify the following variables:
#
# MONITORED_CHANNELS = "new-channel,aws-status"  # Comma-separated channel names (no # prefix)
# SLACK_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN = "breakout"            # Slack workspace subdomain
#
# Benefits of Dashboard management:
# - Changes take effect immediately without deployment
# - Production settings preserved across code deployments  
# - Multiple team members can adjust monitoring without code access
# - No risk of accidentally overwriting production configuration
#
# [vars]
# MONITORED_CHANNELS = "new-channel"      # ⚠️ COMMENTED OUT - Managed in Dashboard
# SLACK_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN = "breakout"    # ⚠️ COMMENTED OUT - Managed in Dashboard
